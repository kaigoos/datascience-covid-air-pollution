##CSV Parser:
The CSV parser is a basic script to parse data by fields under specific columns.
The parser is strictly meant for personal use and is in no way robust or user friendly.
Make sure the input is precise when using.

Formatting option should only be used for files in the Original folder. To modify other files in the Formatted or Modified folder user the Parsing option instead.

To use the parser create a folder called CSV under the main project folder.
Then create 3 sub folders in the CSV folder names Formatted, Modfied, and Original.
